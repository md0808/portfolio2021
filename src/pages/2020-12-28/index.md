I'm working on this in between client projects to gain experience with various libraries and frameworks.

Some of the main technologies I'm using.

Brand new to me:

- Gatsby
- GraphQL
- Netlify

Had some experience, trying to learn new things:

- Material UI
- React
- Redux
- Typescript

Logo and homepage gif were made last year with Adobe inDesign and Photoshop
